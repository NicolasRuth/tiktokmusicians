# „Soon may the record deal come“ – 
# Investigating the power of TikTok for music promotion

This is the repo for the analysis on professional musicians on *TikTok*. Data 
from 20 accounts of musicians in the Top 100 most followed accounts on TikTok 
(via *Socialblade*).

On this repo you can find the Python script for data wrapping, an R script for
data analyses, and some first jpeg plots.

The data was used for a presentation at the conference of the International 
Music Business Research Association (**IMBRA**), November 2021 in Rotterdam. 
Information on the conference can be found here:

Have fun with those TikTok musicians!
